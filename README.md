# Uplift Modeling

Uplift modelling, also known as incremental modelling, true lift modelling, or net modelling is a predictive modelling technique that directly models the incremental impact of a treatment (such as a direct marketing action) on an individual's behaviour.

Uplift modelling has applications in customer relationship management for up-sell, cross-sell and retention modelling. It has also been applied to political election and personalised medicine. Unlike the related Differential Prediction concept in psychology, Uplift Modelling assumes an active agent.

Uplift modeling estimates the effect of communication action on some customer outcomes and gives an opportunity to efficiently target customers which are most likely to respond to a marketing campaign. It is relatively easy to implement, but surprisingly poorly covered in the machine learning courses and literature. This guide is going to shed some light on the essentials of causal inference estimating and uplift modeling.

Uplift modeling estimates a causal effect of treatment and uses it to effectively target customers that are most likely to respond to a marketing campaign.

Use cases for uplift modeling:

- Target customers in the marketing campaign. Quite useful in promotion of some popular product where there is a big part of customers who make a target action by themself without any influence. By modeling uplift you can find customers who are likely to make the target action (for instance, install an app) only when treated (for instance, received a push).
- Combine a churn model and an uplift model to offer some bonus to a group of customers who are likely to churn.
- Select a tiny group of customers in the campaign where a price per customer is high.
